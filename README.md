# Machine Learning Techniques and Large Language Models for Property Rental Price Prediction in Ireland  

## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials for my MSc Data Analytics Capstone Project at **CCT College Dublin**.   
The project investigates the potential of **LLM-based models** to improve the forecasting accuracy compared to **the traditional SARIMA model** and **the modern Prophet model** developed by Facebook for predicting rental prices in Ireland, with a focus on **Dublin quarterly rent data (2007‚Äì2024)**.
## üéØ Research Objectives  
- To evaluate the effectiveness of **ML-based forecasting models** in predicting rental prices based on property features.  
- To assess the effectiveness of **LLMs** to improve prediction accuracy for rental price forecasting in Ireland.
- To provide **an analysis comparing forecasting ML models and LLM-based techniques** that explores how each method approaches the prediction task, the quality of insights they provide, and their suitability for various aspects of the Irish rental market.  

## üóÇ Dataset  
- **Source**: [Central Statistics Office (CSO) Ireland](https://data.cso.ie/table/RIQ02)  
- **Data**: Quarterly average rent prices from 2007 to 2024  
- **Features**: Average rent (‚Ç¨), quarter, number of bedrooms, property type, location  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
### Data Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Location filtering (focus on Dublin)  
- Time formatting (quarterly ‚Üí datetime)  
- Outlier detection  
- Stationarity testing (ADF test)  
- Seasonal decomposition & autocorrelation analysis  

### Models Implemented  
- **SARIMA** (auto-tuned via `pmdarima`)  
- **Prophet** (with Fourier seasonality tuning) 
- **ChatGPT-3.5 & 4-turbo** (zero-shot & few-shot forecasting via OpenAI API)  
- **Time-LLM (GPT-2)** reprogramming framework  
- **Chronos (T5-small, T5-base, T5-large)** pre-trained time series models  

### Evaluation Metrics  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- R¬≤ Score  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  

## üìä Key Findings  
- **SARIMA** best captured seasonality and long-term structure.  
- **Prophet** performed robustly with tuned seasonal parameters.  
- **ChatGPT (few-shot)** achieved lowest point-wise error but failed to reproduce seasonality.  
- **Chronos** provided good short-term forecasts but degraded over longer horizons.  
- **Time-LLM (GPT-2)** was the weakest model, struggling with trend reproduction.  

## üöÄ How to Open & Run the Project  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/madinasagatova/capstone_project.git
cd capstone_project 

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (recommended)  
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

### 5. Then open Capstone_Madina_Sagatova_2021255_clean.ipynb file inside the folder.

### 6. (Optional) Run with OpenAI API
If you want to reproduce ChatGPT zero-/few-shot forecasts:
Create an OpenAI account and get an API key.
Add it as an environment variable:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"   # macOS/Linux
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"     # Windows
Run the LLMs.
